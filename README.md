# Workdaysched

This application presents a 9-5 daily scheduler which is color coded to alert the user to past, present, and future time blocks based on the current time which is
presented at the top of the page. 
Each time block present a text area where text can be saved. 

## Description

I created this application using day.js to keep current time available on the page, as well as JavaScript/Jquery to present past/future based on that given time.
I used local storage to allow users to save their notes in each time block.
